Lost in Translation in Modern Chinese
========

Take a guess. Which of the following words don't exist in pre-Qin Chinese (before 221 BCE)? And yes, I'm giving it away since I used plural... And you don't even have to know Chinese. I'll give you their English translation, too.
* 革命 (Revolution)
* 霸道 (Domineering)
* 共和 (Republic)
* 自由 (Freedom)
* 浪漫 (Romance)

Okay, for native Chinese speakers, it's easy to see that "浪漫" (Romance) is not a word that exists before Qin Dynasty. It's also a homophonic translation. Well, in pinyin, "Làng Màn", not quite homophonic, but close. Actually it may be closer in the past. The main discrepancy comes from 浪 (Làng), which doesn't quite map to the pronunciation of "ro-". But if you look at the Japanese Onyomi for "浪", it straight up is "Rou" (sometimes written as "Rō"), as in "Ronin" (浪人). This is probably an indication that Chinese pronunciation of this character used to be closer to "Lo".

The rest of the four words may seem a bit harder, even for Chinese audiences, actually, because they all seem so... modern. But whether you know Chinese or not, it essentially becomes a guess game about which _concept_ doesn't exist in ancient China. Of course, even though some of these words exist back then, their ancient meanings ain't going to map on to their modern counterparts in an exact manner. But they have to be close, right?

Well... we'll come back on that later. Anyhow, without futher ado, here's the answer: among the rest four, only "自由" (freedom) didn't exist in pre-Qin Chinese. As a matter of fact, "革命" (revolution), "共和" (republic), and "自由" (freedom) are all translations come up by Japanese, so they have Japanese pronunciations, too. And let me tell you, Japanese _love_ to borrow words from pre-Qin Chinese literature to translate stuff. Later in this article, I'm just going to use Chinese characters to refer to the concept in the specific language context, so I'm going to list their pronunciations cross-language here, and you're welcome to pick whatever you like for how they sound in your head:

| Characters | Chinese Pinyin | Japanese Hiragana | Japanese Romaji |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 革命 | Gé Mìng | かくめい | Kakumei |
| 共和 | Gòng Hé | きょうわ | Kyouwa |
| 自由 | Zì Yóu | じゆう | Jiyuu |

And of these three, "freedom" is the only word that made Japanese scratch their heads so hard that they eventually gave up and chose to make up a word for it. "自由", on the surface level, means "to make decisions for oneself", or "to do things as one pleases". And apparently, people in 500 BC China hadn't felt the need to say such a thing... or had they? (Cue Vsauce music, LOL)

I mean, the Roman Republic was founded in 509 BC, and the word "libertas" was already widely used in literature back then. The Japanese also found words in classical Chinese literature that they eventually used as translation for "revolution" and "republic". So, of course there was a way to say "freedom". Or to say the least, there was a way to say "freedom of speech", which was "宣", literally meaning "to let out" in modern Chinese. And to prove to you this word indeed meant "freedom of speech" back then, I'm going to tell you how the Zhou Dynasty (1046 BCE - 256 BCE) briefly became "共和" for 14 years.

The following is quote from [_Records of the Grand Historian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Grand_Historian), a.k.a. _Shiji_:

```
王行暴虐侈傲，国人谤王。召公谏曰：“民不堪命矣。”王怒，得卫巫，使监谤者，以告则杀之。其谤鲜矣，诸侯不朝。三十四年，王益严，国人莫敢言，道路以目。厉王喜，告召公曰：“吾能弭谤矣，乃不敢言。”召公曰：“是鄣之也。防民之口，甚于防水。水壅而溃，伤人必多，民亦如之。是故为水者决之使导，为民者宣之使言。”——《史记·周本纪》
```

Translation by me:

King Li of Zhou enacted tyranny, abuse, excessively lavish spending, and arrogance. People in the state criticized him. Duke Zhao reproached: "Your people can't live with it!" The King was furious. He attained assistance from a priest from Wei, had him to surveil the critics, and killed those who were reported. The criticism became scarce, and his vassals stopped paying homage. Year 34 (of the King's reign), the King became even harsher. The state people dared not to speak, only eyeing each other on the road. King Li rejoiced, told Duke Zhao: "I can eradicate criticism now. Thou dare not to speak against me." Duke Zhao said: "This is merely burying the problem. To block people's mouth is worse than blocking a flood: water overflows and breaches the dam, and will always harm lots of men. And so are the people like this. So a civil engineer controls a flood by dredging water channels; a ruler governs his people by letting them speak out (**宣**之使言)."

So what's the ending for this tyrannical King Li? _Shiji_ documented:

```
“于是国莫敢出言，三年，乃相与畔，袭厉王。厉王出奔于彘。厉王太子静匿召公之家，国人闻之，乃围之。召公...乃以其子代王太子，太子竟得脱。召公、周公二相行政，号曰‘共和’。共和十四年，厉王死于彘。太子静长于召公家，二相乃共立之为王，是为宣王。”——《史记·周本纪》
```

Translation by me:

So no one in the state dared to speak out. Three years later, the people revolted and attacked King Li. King Li escaped to Zhi. King Li's Crown Prince Jing stowed away at Duke Zhao's house. The state people heard of it, and surrounded the house. Duke Zhao... handed over his son in place of the Crown Prince, and the Crown Prince eventually cheated death. The two ministers Duke Zhao and Duke Zhou ran the government. This reign is named "共和" (lit. coexisting peacefully, in modern Chinese's sense). Year 14 of the reign, King Li died in Zhi. The Crown Prince Jing grew up at Duke Zhao's house. The two ministers together installed him as the King, who later became King Xuan of Zhou.

Alright, two takeaways:
1. So, from the story, we can see "共和" doesn't exactly mean "republic" - it just means a period in Chinese history when the central state had no monarch, and the government was run by the ministers, who were also aristocrats, actually. So it was more like "aristocracy" if you ask me.
2. You might have noticed that King Xuan of Zhou (周宣王) has "宣" in his name, this word we say that's equivalent to "freedom of speech" in ancient Chinese, and since these names for Chinese kings and emperors are actually posthumous names, it's likely that King Xuan took the listen and reversed many of his father's policies. And by the way, the "厉" in King Li is best translated as... "draconian". Yea. So looks like both Western and Eastern people got this concept from <mark title="Well, technically Marquess Li of Jin (晋厉侯) came before King Li of Zhou, but very few was documented about him.">kings</mark>.

The obvious difference between "共和" and "republic" is that in a republic regime, officials are elected, while the 14-year period of "共和" the Zhou state had were simply ruled by aristocrats. Truly there wasn't a matching concept of "republic" in ancient Chinese, nevertheless we still use this word Japanese dug up from China's ancient history. But knowing the history makes me wonder. The revolt that exiled King Li is estimated to have happened in 842 BCE or 841 BCE. You know, Zhou Dynasty was a collection of feudal monarchies, with the Zhou state being the central power. What if Duke Zhao didn't have a son who's about the same age as the Crown Prince? Then the Crown Prince would have been killed, and the Zhou state could have gone "共和" forever. That would have brought some diversity to the forms of governments in the land that is now northern China, and history would be very different. You know, Rome also started as a Kingdom and became a Republic. I'd say it's not impossible.

But I digress. So why didn't the Japanese take "宣" as the translation for "freedom", then? I'd say "宣" is closer to "freedom" than "共和" is to "republic". I think the fact that "宣" is a one-syllable word in both Chinese and Japanese ("Xuān" in Chinese and "Sen" in Japanese Onyomi) probably mattered a lot, since one-syllable words are generally not preferred to be used for new concepts in any languages. The two-syllable translation they invented is pretty good by all means. It has left a profound impact on both Chinese and Japanese society. Speak of which, what does "freedom" mean anyway in the most literal sense? Well, English is a second language to me, so I could be wrong on this, but "free" in English actually means "not having", e.g. "smoke free zone" means "no smoking here" (which is the complete opposite to "smoke freely" LOL), so "freedom", by its literal sense, should mean "the state of not having". You can say, specficially, it means "the state of not having someone to oppress you". In that spirit, I think another ancient Chinese word can also be a candidate for the translation, which is "逍遥" (Chinese pinyin: Xiāo Yáo). Nowadays this word usually means "free from worries", and its meaning doesn't seem to have changed much throughout the history. From how it's used in Taoist literature, which is the earliest record where we could find it, it does seem to mean some kind of liberation of mind by freeing oneself from desires. If you think this kind of sounds like Buddhism, it's because these two schools do share lots of similarities despite their very different and distinct origins. However, nowadays "逍遥" also kind of have a negative light to it, as the phrase "逍遥法外" means that someone has escaped justice. As the other two characters in that phrase mean "law" and "outside" respectively, I guess you could say literally the phrase translates to "being free beyond the law". Even when used not in combination with other words, it's often associated with laziness. So, admittedly, it's maybe not a good candidate for the translation of "freedom".

Okay, so, maybe there's something left to be desired for "共和" as the translation for "republic", but if you don't examine it with a microscope perhaps you could let that pass. However, when I took a similar close look at "革命", the translation for "revolution", I actually found something interesting.

So, "革命" is also a word dug up by Japanese from pre-Qin literature, and specifically, from I-Ching. The original text is as followed:

```
“汤武革命，顺乎天而应乎人，革之时大矣哉！”——《周易·革卦》
```

Translation by... Oh wait, that's going to give away what this word _actually_ means. So let's focus on what these two characters _should_ mean literally first.

So, if you ask a native Chinese speaker what "革" and "命" mean respectively... For "革", one would say... leather, probably. And, yes, that's right, when it's a noun. When it's a verb, one would probably say, it means "to change", or "to renew". Meanwhile, "命" could mean "life" or "fate", but in the original text, it actually means something a bit more exotic to modern Chinese: the mandate of heaven, as in "天命". And what does the mandate of heaven decide? Who's the rightful ruler of the world, of course. That's the narrative Zhou Dynasty government use to justify their reign posteriorly, that they were able to gain the status they had not just because they achieved some victory militarily, but actually, the mandate of heaven changed, and the previous ruler had the blessing from the heaven no longer.

And so the above quote translates to:

Tang (the founder of Shang Dynasty, who overthrew the Xia Dynasty) and Wu (the founder of Zhou Dynasty, who overthrew the Shang Dynasty) renewed the mandate of heaven, the time of the renewal was great indeed!

So while we often think of revolution as some grassroots uprising, the translation, in its literal sense, actually just refers to replacing one dynasty with another. Doesn't sound so "revolutionary" now, isn't it? That is until you _actually_ think about what "revolution" _really_ means... It means coming back to the same point after rotating a full circle... Like, the "RPM" metric on your car, which is an acronym for "revolutions per minute". And sometimes, that's what real human revolutions do. For example, the French Revolution, which overthrew the House of Bourbon, with people demanding for freedom, but eventually, Napoleon just became France's new emperor. So, in this sense, the translation is actually maybe kind of accurate. (LOL)

As for the last word we haven't talked about, "霸道" (Chinese pinyin: Bà Dào), meaning "domineering" in modern Chinese, if you are curious about the etymology of this word, this is not a translation, but simply a word that's native to modern Chinese. The first character means "hegemon" while the second means "the way", and therefore, literally this word means "the way of a hegemon", and you can probably see why it means "domineering". However, in ancient Chinese, its meaning is a lot more moderate. Consider the following from _Xunzi_, one of the classic Confucian literature:

```
“明其不并之行，信其友敌之道，天下无王霸主，则常胜矣。是知霸道者也。”——《荀子·王制》
```

Tranlsation by me:

Explicating their code of not annexing others, and showing integrity in their way of making allies and enemies, so long as there isn't a preponderant power under the heaven, they will always achieve victory. That is how those who understand the way of hegemons will act.

In the context of the quote, the Confucian philosopher Xunzi was categorizing governments into three types of regimes, kind of like what Plato did in his book _Republic_. The three types of regimes Xunzi categorized, from best to worst, were:
* 王道 (Chinese pinyin: Wáng Dào), the way of kings, highlighted by their ability to attract people from all over the world (王夺之人). True "kingdoms" (in Xunzi's mind) achieve this through outperforming other states in three key areas he deemed important. Quote (translation by me): "Far exceeding all others in policies that promote <mark title='Yes, the usual translation for "仁" is "benevolence". I just want to make it sound more tangible here.'>loving of people</mark>, far exceeding all others in honoring alliances with other states, far exceeding all others in military might" (仁眇天下，义眇天下，威眇天下)
* 霸道 (Chinese pinyin: Bà Dào), the way of hegemons, highlighted by their ability to gain alliances via diplomatic means (霸夺之与). Hegemon states achieve this through... to put it short, trying very hard. Specifically:
  - "辟田野，实仓廪，便备用": Have good agricultural output and enough food reserves
  - "案谨募选阅材伎之士，然后渐庆赏以先之，严刑罚以纠之": Have a meritocratic system that promote competent people, and when that's achieved, also establish rules with very clear rewards and punishments to rein in the social elites promoted by the said system
  - "存亡继绝，卫弱禁暴，而无兼并之心，则诸侯亲之矣；修友敌之道，以敬接诸侯，则诸侯说之矣": Gain other states' trust by protecting the weak, stopping violence, treating others with respect and mannerism, and carefully managing allies and enemies
* 强道 (Chinese pinyin: Qiáng Dào), the way of strongmen, hightlighted by their ability to annex other states' territories (强夺之地). Strongman states achieve this by:
  - Paradoxically, not militarily conquering others all the time. Quote (translation by me): "Others' people want to fight me more and more day by day, and my people want to fight for me less and less day by day, so a strong state in turn becomes weak... Thus, those who understand the way of strongman don't focus on looking strong" (人之民日欲与我斗，吾民日不欲为我斗，是强者之所以反弱也... 知强大者不务强也)
  - Being self-sufficient and uniting people under one ideology. Well, technically the original text says "全其力，凝其德", which literally translates to "completing their power and consolidating their virtues"

However, of these three words only "霸道" is still frequently used today, and its meaning has... kind of changed, technically. By Xunzi's description, "霸道" is umm... pretty much how an average country would operate nowadays?? Yea, so what I'm getting at is, it doesn't sound particularly "domineering". It was more of a neutral word than a negative one. Though, to be fair, in English, the "domin-" in "domineering" also came from "dominus" in Latin, which simply means "lord".

If you are really curious, the reason why the word "hegemon" sounds a lot more tame in _Xunzi_ probably has something to do with the fact that during a period dubbed "the Spring and Autumn Period" of Zhou Dynasty, there were not one, but five hegemon states that dominated what is now northern China. Zhou Dynasty, during its peak, had never experience a time when the "international order" was truly unipolar.
