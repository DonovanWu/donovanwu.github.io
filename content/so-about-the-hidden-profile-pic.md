So, About the Hidden Profile Pic
========

I've said on the front page that there are easter eggs. Hint: move your mouse cursor on my profile picture and wait for a few seconds. :)

The other intended way of discovering it is to try to open my profile pic in a new tab (or saving it), then you'll find there's a hidden image layered on top of it.

That is the easy one, so I can give it away. Other ones you may need to inspect the HTML code to see what are not shown. Don't worry, there is nothing too complicated.

So, about this hidden profile pic, there's a little story behind it. You may have noticed there are some texts on the very top of the image. Now here's a higher-resolution version:

You may wonder why there is what seems to be an exam question there. It does look like the drawing is answering that question, too. Well, it will make much more sense if you see the original. And the original is a doodle I actually drew during an exam. Here's a picture of it:

The CSE 374 class was a computer science class at University of Washington intended for non-CS-major students. Back then I was in Applied Math major, and UW's Computer Science department is pretty darn hard to get in, considering its reputation. So I was very lucky that the school offered such classes for non-CS students. If I'm not mistaken, the class taught you C programming language basics, which is why I put the famous [The C Programming Language (Second Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) book in the background of the colorized version. If you squint you'll see it on the bookshelf.

Since the course was intended for non-major, it was... um... designed to encourage learning, let's just say. It was not designed to let you have a taste of what being a CS student is really like (which is to get rekt each and every day XD). Anyway, <mark title="I don't exactly recall how much but it was at least half an hour.">I had plenty of time left</mark> after finishing all questions and was pretty confident I should have at most made very minor mistakes. And since the extra credit explicitly stated that blank answer would not be considered as "creativity" and given credit, I decided to go out of my way to score this one point. I guess it was some reverse reverse psychology. XD

Too bad I'm no artist, otherwise our TA back then would enjoy some high-quality waifu. XD

And no, the colorized version is not AI generated. I did it myself. You could clearly tell it because my drawing skill sucks and AI-generated art would be much better (LOL). Maybe some day I will try to feed the pencil drawing to an AI and see what it outputs. But, you know, sometimes it's not about how good the art is, but rather, it's about love, community, creative control, blah blah blah, all those stuff. The character I drew is a character I have been trying to construct in my head for 10+ years. She's been truly living rent free in my head. Maybe I'll talk about it some other time.
