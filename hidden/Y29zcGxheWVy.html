                        Alright, you will soon see that this is probably the most normal cosplay photos I will post on this page. XD<br>
                        Disclaimer: I don't own this photo. It was downloaded from the web all those years ago, but I couldn't find it online anymore.<br>
                        Partially, I'm putting this picture here to promote the city I live in (LOL). But also, for me personally, it represented a time when things were a little different from how they are today. Back then, Chengdu was not many years into hosting these conventions, and those who attended were in a more exploratory spirit. It was an exhilarating time to meet with people who share the same hobby with you. It was also a time when I remember seeing titles like "It's Time To Let Go of the GDP Complex" on newspaper... Well, guess things were at least a little different back then, huh.<br>
                        Oh, and one more thing. So the two cosplayers in the photo were cosplaying Black Rock Shooter and... who? I think it took me six years or so to finally figure it out... It's Akemi Homura from <em>Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica</em>. It might not be so immediately obvious since Homura usually has a more stoic look.

                        You might have only noticed the Homura cosplayer wearing Madoka's panties on her head at first. Alright, this is a meme in itself. As I have mentioned above, Homura is a fairly stoic character, but there was a popular made-up lore within the community back then (before the <em>Rebellion</em> movie came out), that Homura was going through all the suffering only because she was secretly gay for Madoka and wanted to do perverted things with her. So, yea, that was that.<br>
                        But look again, who's standing to her right... XD<br>
                        Best... best couple ever! If your heterosexual relationship feels like a homosexual one, you know you're doing something right! XD<br>

                        Sometimes I like seeing parents dressing up their kids and bringing them to cons and can't help but to wonder what the kids will think of their parents when they eventually grow up and watch the show. XD<br>
                        This is one of those cases, and it's like the most creative I've seen. It's not only very cute, but also pretty funny due to the subtle undertone about parenthood. If you have watched the show you'll understand the message here. XD<br>
                        And if you haven't noticed, the kid's dad was cross dressing as Tomoe Mami right beside them. XD
