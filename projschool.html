							SARA Semantics Aware Robotic Assistants
						</h3>
						
						<p class="info-title">
							Overview:
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a school research project on Artificial Intelligence in CSE department. The project builds
							a robot that can navigate through the building by itself and finish some simple tasks people 
							ask, such as checking if a certain person is in a certain room.
						</p>
						
						<p class="info-title">
							Sub-project 1: Simulation
						</p>
						<p>
							The simulation uses a modified morse package and runs in blender game engine.
						</p>
						<p>Primarily worked on...</p>
						<ul>
							<li>building a computer simulation for the robot.</li>
							<li>setting up the CSE building environment in the simulation.</li>
							<li>setting up human object (with elevator-calling function) in the simulation.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Main purpose of the simulation:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The simulation serves as a convenient way to test out robot's function, new code, etc. 
								so that it is not necessary to do it in reality every time. Also, the simulation 
								makes it possible for multiple people to do robot testing at the same time because they can 
								just do it on their own computer, while testing out in reality on actual robot only allows one 
								person a time.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Here is a screenshot for the simulation we built up:
						</p>
						<img class="item-block" src="img/sim_scrnsht.png" />
						
						<p class="info-title">
							Sub-project 2: Robot's Camera Tilting
						</p>
						<p>
							Primarily worked on...
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								planning out a navigation scheme for the robot using state machine, in which tilting the camera 
								is a part of navigation steps.
							</li>
							<li>writing an action server and client for tilting the robotâ€™s camera to a given degree.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The code is tested in previously built simulation.

						<h3>
							Nanocrafter
						</h3>
						
						<p class="info-title">
							Overview:
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a research project in Center for Game Science (CGS) at University of Washington, in which we 
							made an educational game. Nanocrafter is a game that teaches people about DNA as well as a tool of 
							doing DNA reaction simulation.
						</p>
						
						<p class="info-title">
							Sub-project 1: Implementing helping hand's tutorial for concentration change
						</p>
						<p>
							Implemented new function to helping hand in game and made it able to point to + or - sign position of 
							the widget that shows DNA concentration.
						</p>
						<p>
							Level designers can tell the helping hand where to go by putting its position code (updated now) in level JSON.
						</p>
						
						<p class="info-title">
							Sub-project 2: VCR control of reaction playback
						</p>
						<p>
							Consists of both front-end and back-end work:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="info-title">On front-end side: </span>
								Designed playback button layout during reaction playback and implemented them (most of their code already 
								existed, such as pause and rewind, so I just linked the code to playback buttons)
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="info-title">On back-end side: </span>
								Modified playback animation class to take animation speed into consideration, so that fast-forward and 
								slow-down buttons actually work. The animation speed uses a jumping or interpolating frame fashion to 
								speed up or slow down playback animation.
							</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="info-title">
							Sub-project 3: Concentration split animation
						</p>
						<p>
							Concentration split action in game no longer just kicks the split DNA off a little bit, but replaced by a smooth
							transition animation. The split DNA also cleverly finds a relatively empty space on stage and moves to that position.
						</p>
						
						<p class="info-title">
							Sub-project 4: Smart Camera
						</p>
						<p>
							In progress...
